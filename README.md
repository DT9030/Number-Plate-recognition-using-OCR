# 🚗 Number Plate Recognition using Python & EasyOCR

This project demonstrates a simple and efficient way to recognize vehicle number plates using Python's `EasyOCR` library along with `OpenCV`. The system captures an image of a vehicle, extracts the license plate area, and uses OCR to read the characters.
